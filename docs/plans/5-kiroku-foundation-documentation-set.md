# Kiroku foundation documentation set

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries,
Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must be kept up to date as work proceeds.


## Purpose / Big Picture

After this change, the unified keiro-runtime documentation site (a fumadocs +
TanStack Start static-SPA + MDX app living in this repo) contains a complete, accurate, navigable documentation set for
**kiroku** — the append-only PostgreSQL **event store** that is the persistence foundation
of the keiro runtime family. A reader who lands on `/docs/kiroku` can:

- understand what kiroku *is* (an event STORE, not a decider/aggregate framework) and how
  its storage model works (streams, categories, the `$all` log, gap-free global order);
- follow a hands-on **tutorial** that migrates a database, opens a `Store`, appends events
  with optimistic concurrency (`ExpectedVersion`), reads a stream back, and runs a live
  subscription — all with code that compiles against the **real** kiroku API;
- look up the exact signatures of the `Store` effect operations and the core domain types
  (`EventData`, `RecordedEvent`, `ExpectedVersion`, `StreamName`, `StreamVersion`,
  `GlobalPosition`) in a **reference** section;
- complete focused **how-to** tasks (run against Postgres, enable OpenTelemetry via
  `kiroku-otel`, build a projection, integrate with shibuya via `shibuya-kiroku-adapter`);
- copy a **cookbook** recipe; and
- learn the user-land **decider / evolve** pattern that kiroku deliberately does *not*
  ship, presented as an application pattern layered on top of the store.

You can see it working by running the docs dev server (`pnpm dev`, i.e. `vite dev`) — or a
production build with `pnpm build && pnpm start` (the build emits a static SPA under
`.output/public`) — and browsing
`http://localhost:3000/docs/kiroku`: the kiroku tree appears in the sidebar with the page
order defined in `content/docs/kiroku/meta.json`; Haskell snippets render in PragmataPro with
ligatures (`->`, `=>`, `<-`, `::`, `>>=` shown as glyphs); and at least one `mermaid`
diagram (the append → store → subscribe flow) renders as an interactive, zoomable diagram.

This is the **content** plan. It populates `content/docs/kiroku/` only. It does *not* build
the app, the highlighter, the font, the Mermaid component, or the IA/template system — those
are owned by sibling plans (see Context). This plan PORTS kiroku's already-written docs
(under the kiroku source tree) into the site's IA and FILLS the known gaps.


## Progress

Use a checklist to summarize granular steps. Every stopping point must be documented here,
even if it requires splitting a partially completed task into two ("done" vs. "remaining").
This section must always reflect the actual current state of the work.

- [x] M0. Preconditions verified — toolchain (Node 22 + pnpm 11) on PATH, `node_modules`
      present, `content/docs/kiroku/` (and all Plan D Diátaxis subdirs) exist, baseline
      `pnpm typecheck` clean, kiroku source tree readable for cross-checking. _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M1. Landing + overview page (`index.mdx`) authored — "store not framework" callout,
      append→store→subscribe `mermaid`, `<Cards>` index. _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M2. Getting-started tutorial authored at `tutorials/getting-started.mdx`
      (migrate → withStore → append → read → subscribe). _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M3. Explanation pages authored (event sourcing; append-only log; streams & categories;
      `$all` + global order incl. `mermaid` junction diagram; optimistic concurrency;
      subscriptions & consumer groups; causation & correlation). _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M4. Reference seed authored — `reference/store-effect.mdx` (Store GADT + every op
      signature + interpreters) and `reference/core-types.mdx` (`<TypeTable>` for `EventData`/
      `RecordedEvent`, the newtypes, `ExpectedVersion`, and the full `StoreError` catalog read
      from `Kiroku.Store.Error`). _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M5. How-to guides authored under `how-to/` (run against Postgres; enable OpenTelemetry;
      build a projection; integrate with shibuya). _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M6. Cookbook recipe authored at `cookbook/idempotent-append.mdx` (supply `eventId`, treat
      `DuplicateEvent` as success). _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M7. Known-gap tutorial authored at `tutorials/decider-and-evolve.mdx` (user-land
      decider/evolve pattern, with the "kiroku ships no such typeclass" Callout). _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M8. All section `meta.json` files populated and ordered; six section `index.mdx` landings
      enriched with `<Cards>` (removed "coming soon"); `pnpm typecheck` clean; `pnpm build` exits
      0, prerenders all 28 kiroku pages with **zero** crawler warnings; search index carries the
      new pages; snippets cross-checked against `kiroku-store/src` (all names present); framing
      check passed (no `decide`/`evolve` presented as a kiroku API outside the tutorial).
      Browser-only ligature/mermaid-interactivity checks deferred (see Surprises). _(2026-05-30)_
- [x] M9. Subscription **code walkthrough** authored under `walkthrough/` (user request) — a
      four-part ordered tour: `00-start-here` (the pure-FSM/impure-driver design + overview
      `mermaid`), `01-the-state-machine` (`Fsm.hs` states + `Input`/`Effect` + `step`),
      `02-the-worker-driver` (`Worker.hs` catch-up→live + per-event delivery + checkpointing),
      `03-subscribe-and-lifecycle` (`Subscription.hs` `subscribe`/`withSubscription` + cleanup
      contract). Built directly from the real source. _(2026-05-30)_


## Surprises & Discoveries

Document unexpected behaviors, bugs, optimizations, or insights discovered during
implementation. Provide concise evidence.

- **The real subscription API is richer than this plan's §Context transcription.** Reading
  `kiroku-store/src/Kiroku/Store/Subscription/{Types,Fsm}.hs` shows:
  - `subscribe :: (MonadIO m) => KirokuStore -> SubscriptionConfig -> m SubscriptionHandle`
    and `withSubscription :: (MonadUnliftIO m) => …` — monad-polymorphic, not `IO`-only.
  - `SubscriptionResult = Continue | Stop | Retry !RetryDelay | DeadLetter !DeadLetterReason`
    (the plan listed only `Continue | Stop`). The extra two drive bounded retry + dead-letter.
  - `OverflowPolicy = PauseAndResume | DropSubscription | DropOldest`; the **default is
    `PauseAndResume`** (lossless recoverable backpressure), not `DropSubscription`.
  - `SubscriptionHandle { cancel :: m (), wait :: m (Either SomeException ()), currentState :: m SubscriptionState }`.
  - `SubscriptionConfig` also carries `batchSize` (default 100), `queueCapacity` (default 16),
    `consumerGroupGuard`, `retryPolicy`, `eventTypeFilter`, and an opaque `selector` escape hatch.
  - The FSM (`Fsm.hs`) names six states: `CatchingUp`, `Live`, `Paused`, `Reconnecting`,
    `Retrying`, `Stopped`, driven by one exhaustively-matched pure `step :: SubscriptionState
    -> Input -> (SubscriptionState, [Effect])` interpreted by the impure `runWorker`.
  - `subscribe` throws `InvalidConsumerGroup` eagerly on a bad `(member, size)` instead of
    returning `Either`.
  Bearing: content snippets and the reference page use the **real** shapes; the subscription
  walkthrough (M9) is built directly on `Fsm.hs`/`Worker.hs`.
- **Relative MDX links (`./sibling`) resolve WRONG in the static SPA and trip the prerender
  crawler.** The multi-part walkthrough first used `[…](./01-the-state-machine)`. From the page
  `/docs/kiroku/walkthrough/00-start-here`, the browser/crawler resolves `./01-…` relative to the
  *current* path as if it were a directory, producing
  `/docs/kiroku/walkthrough/00-start-here/01-the-state-machine` — a nonexistent nested route. The
  build still exited 0 but emitted `[unhandledRejection] Failed to fetch …` for every such link,
  and the links would 404 for users. **Fix:** use **absolute** doc paths
  (`/docs/kiroku/walkthrough/01-the-state-machine`) for all cross-page links. **For #6 (CI):** a
  cheap, high-value gate is to fail the build (or a link-check) on any `[…](./…)` /  `[…](../…)`
  relative link in `content/docs/**`, or on any `unhandledRejection`/`Failed to fetch` line in the
  build log.
- **Browser-only checks remain deferred** (same as Plan #3's note): ligature *glyph* rendering and
  mermaid *pan/zoom interactivity* need a human browser pass. Verified programmatically instead:
  the build prerenders all 28 kiroku pages, `rehypeMermaid` is prepended ahead of Shiki in
  `source.config.ts`, 3 `mermaid` fences and 18 MDX files with ligature-bearing operators are
  present, and the fences use the verified multi-line header style.


## Decision Log

Record every decision made while working on the plan.

- Decision: kiroku is documented as an event **store**, never as a decider/aggregate
  framework. `decide`/`evolve`/`fold`/`apply`/`project` are presented as user-land patterns,
  not library APIs.
  Rationale: The library ships no such typeclasses; this is a deliberate design boundary
  confirmed by reading the source (no `decide`/`evolve` anywhere in `kiroku-store`). Mislabeling
  it would make every downstream example wrong.
  Date: 2026-05-30
- Decision: Author against the **real** API names transcribed inline in this plan; verify by
  cross-checking the kiroku source modules and (optionally) compiling `kiroku-jitsurei` before
  declaring snippets correct.
  Rationale: Snippet accuracy is an explicit acceptance criterion.
  Date: 2026-05-30
- Decision: The docs app was re-scaffolded on **TanStack Start (static SPA)** instead of
  Next.js; this plan's tooling references were updated accordingly. The MDX authoring
  substance (content, Haskell snippets, frontmatter, Diátaxis mapping, kiroku source-of-truth
  paths) is framework-agnostic and is unchanged. Only docs-app file/command references move:
  `mdx-components.tsx` → `src/components/mdx.tsx`, `lib/source.ts` → `src/lib/source.ts`,
  `app/global.css` → `src/styles/app.css`, `next.config.mjs` → `vite.config.ts`,
  `next dev`/`next build` → `vite dev`/`vite build` (`pnpm dev`/`pnpm build`); the import
  alias `@/...` resolves to `./src/...`. Verification now browses the SPA where MDX renders
  client-side.
  Rationale: Plan A (the scaffold) is now a TanStack Start static SPA and is already
  re-implemented and committed; the content plan must reference the real files a contributor
  will see, while preserving intent and scope.
  Date: 2026-05-30
- Decision: **Conform to Plan D's ACTUAL directory structure**, which differs from this plan's
  anticipated layout. Plan D created per-product Diátaxis subtrees as
  `tutorials/ how-to/ reference/ explanation/ cookbook/ walkthrough/` + a root `faq.mdx`, each
  with a placeholder `index.mdx` and `meta.json`. So: the how-to directory is `how-to/` (NOT
  `how-to-guides/`, though its sidebar title is "How-To Guides"); the getting-started and
  decider/evolve tutorials live under `tutorials/` (NOT at the kiroku root); section landing
  pages are the existing `index.mdx` files (I enrich them in place rather than leaving "coming
  soon"). The page-set substance from the file-map table is unchanged; only the paths move to
  match Plan D.
  Rationale: Plan D owns `content/docs/**` structure (Integration Points); the content plan
  populates within it. Inventing a parallel `how-to-guides/` tree would fork the IA.
  Date: 2026-05-30
- Decision: Author MDX **without `import` lines** for `Callout`/`Cards`/`Card`/`Steps`/`Tabs`/
  `TypeTable`/`Accordions`/`Mermaid`. Plan A/D register them globally in
  `src/components/mdx.tsx` via `getMDXComponents`, and every Plan D placeholder page uses them
  bare. Matching that keeps the pages consistent and avoids duplicate-import drift.
  Rationale: Confirmed by reading `src/components/mdx.tsx` (all components spread into the map)
  and the existing placeholder pages (no imports).
  Date: 2026-05-30
- Decision: Add a **subscription-focused code walkthrough** under `walkthrough/` (a multi-part
  ordered tour of the real `Kiroku.Store.Subscription.*` source: the pure FSM `step` in
  `Fsm.hs` and the impure `runWorker` driver in `Worker.hs`, plus the catch-up→live phases).
  Rationale: Explicit user request ("for kiroku, it would be good to have a code walkthrough
  especially for the subscription part"). Plan D already scaffolded an empty `walkthrough/`
  section, so this fills it. Tracked as milestone M9.
  Date: 2026-05-30
- Decision: Where the real kiroku source diverges from this plan's transcription, **follow the
  source** (per the plan's own Idempotence/Recovery guidance). Notable deltas, recorded in
  Surprises & Discoveries: `subscribe`/`withSubscription` are `MonadIO`/`MonadUnliftIO` (not
  `IO`-only); `SubscriptionResult` also has `Retry`/`DeadLetter`; `OverflowPolicy` adds
  `PauseAndResume` (the default); `SubscriptionHandle.wait :: m (Either SomeException ())`; the
  FSM has five live states (`CatchingUp`/`Live`/`Paused`/`Reconnecting`/`Retrying`) + `Stopped`.
  Date: 2026-05-30


## Outcomes & Retrospective

Summarize outcomes, gaps, and lessons learned at major milestones or at completion.
Compare the result against the original purpose.

**Complete (2026-05-30).** `content/docs/kiroku/` is now a full Diátaxis documentation set,
populated within Plan D's structure. A reader landing on `/docs/kiroku` gets the
store-not-framework framing, an append→store→subscribe diagram, and a `<Cards>` index; from there
the sidebar carries a getting-started tutorial, the user-land decider/evolve tutorial, seven
explanation pages (incl. the `$all`/global-order junction diagram), two reference pages, four
how-to guides, a cookbook recipe, and — beyond the original plan, at the user's request — a
four-part **subscription code walkthrough** built from the real `Kiroku.Store.Subscription.*`
source.

What landed vs. the original plan:
- **Structure.** Conformed to Plan D's actual tree (`tutorials/ how-to/ reference/ explanation/
  cookbook/ walkthrough/` + `faq.mdx`) rather than the plan's anticipated `how-to-guides/` +
  root-level tutorials. The page-set substance was unchanged; only paths moved.
- **API accuracy.** Authored against the real source, which is richer than the plan's §Context
  transcription (notably the subscription surface). Every API name used is present in
  `kiroku-store/src` (verified); the deltas are recorded in Surprises & Decision Log.
- **Added scope.** The subscription walkthrough (M9) was not in the original milestone set; it was
  requested mid-implementation and slots into Plan D's empty `walkthrough/` section.

Verification: `pnpm typecheck` clean; `pnpm build` exits 0, prerenders all 28 kiroku pages with
zero crawler warnings; search index includes the new pages; snippet and framing checks pass.
Deferred (browser-only, same as Plan #3): visual confirmation of PragmataPro ligature glyphs and
mermaid pan/zoom interactivity.

Lessons for the next content plans (keiro/keiki/shibuya): (1) read the sibling structure plan's
*actual* output, not just its prose, before authoring; (2) the real Haskell source is
authoritative over any transcription — cross-check names and shapes; (3) use **absolute** doc
links, never `./relative` ones, in the SPA; (4) a code walkthrough that reads real source is
high-value and worth offering per library.


## Context and Orientation

Read this whole section before editing. It is written so that a novice with only this file
and the working tree can complete the work.

### What you are building

You are writing MDX content files under `content/docs/kiroku/` in **this** repository
(`/Users/shinzui/Keikaku/bokuno/keiro-runtime-docs`). The site itself is a **fumadocs**
documentation app (fumadocs-ui 16.9.3 + fumadocs-mdx 15.0.10) built on **TanStack Start as a
static SPA** (React 19 + MDX, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, bundled with **Vite**), built and
served with **pnpm** on **Node 22** inside the Nix dev shell (`nix develop`). `pnpm dev` runs
`vite dev`; `pnpm build` runs `vite build` and emits a static SPA under `.output/public`,
served by `pnpm start`. MDX is compiled by fumadocs-mdx and rendered client-side in the SPA.
Content lives under `content/docs/`. Each directory has a
`meta.json` that controls the sidebar (its `pages` array lists child page slugs / nested
directory names in display order). A page is an `.mdx` file with YAML frontmatter
(`title`, `description`) followed by MDX body.

The documented **code samples are Haskell** (the site is TypeScript, the subject is a
Haskell library). Every Haskell snippet must use kiroku's real API, transcribed below.

### Sibling plans and how this plan depends on them (reference by path only)

This plan is **Plan E** in the master plan
`docs/masterplans/1-keiro-runtime-docs-infrastructure-and-kiroku-foundation.md`.

- **HARD DEP — Plan A** (`docs/plans/1-scaffold-the-fumadocs-documentation-app.md`):
  scaffolds the fumadocs app on **TanStack Start (static SPA)** (already re-implemented and
  committed). After Plan A, `pnpm dev` (`vite dev`) serves a styled empty docs site;
  `source.config.ts`, `src/lib/source.ts`, `src/components/mdx.tsx`, `src/styles/app.css`,
  `vite.config.ts`, the route layouts under `src/routes/`, and `content/docs/` with
  `index.mdx` + `meta.json` all exist. **You cannot build or preview your pages until Plan A
  is done.**
- **HARD DEP — Plan D** (`docs/plans/4-documentation-information-architecture-and-authoring-system.md`):
  defines the product-first IA, the location `content/docs/kiroku/`, the per-doc-type page
  **templates** (one per Diátaxis type: Tutorial, How-To Guide, Reference, Explanation, plus
  Cookbook), the shared MDX components to prefer (fumadocs-ui 16.9.3 built-ins: `Callout`,
  `Steps`, `Tabs`, `Cards`, `TypeTable`, registered in `src/components/mdx.tsx`), and the
  authoring/style conventions. **Copy the matching
  template for each page from Plan D's templates; do not invent a different page shape.**
- **SOFT DEP — Plan B** (`docs/plans/2-pragmatapro-font-and-shiki-code-ligatures.md` —
  confirm exact slug in `docs/plans/`): PragmataPro font + Shiki Haskell highlighting +
  ligatures. If Plan B is not yet merged, your `haskell` fences still render (plain), and the
  ligature acceptance check is deferred — note it in Progress.
- **SOFT DEP — Plan C** (`docs/plans/3-beautiful-mermaid-diagrams-with-zoom-pan.md` — confirm
  exact slug): interactive Mermaid. If Plan C is not yet merged, a ```` ```mermaid ```` fence
  renders as a code block instead of a diagram; the interactivity check is deferred.

Because B and C are soft deps, you author the ` ```haskell ` and ` ```mermaid ` fences now
regardless; they light up automatically once B and C land.

### Integration point you own a slice of

`content/docs/**` + `meta.json` is the shared content tree. Plan D **structures** it (creates
the directory skeleton and top-level `content/docs/meta.json`); **this plan populates the
`kiroku/` subtree**, including `content/docs/kiroku/meta.json`. Do not modify other products'
subtrees. When you touch `content/docs/meta.json` (top-level), only ensure `kiroku` is listed;
do not reorder or remove sibling products.

### The subject: kiroku, transcribed from source (use these REAL names)

Source of truth on disk (read-only, for cross-checking — do **not** edit it):
`/Users/shinzui/Keikaku/bokuno/kiroku-project/kiroku`. The facts below are transcribed
verbatim from that tree (cabal files, the `.hs` modules, the bootstrap `.sql`, and
`docs/`). Treat this subsection as your API cheat-sheet; you should rarely need to open the
source except to confirm a detail or to compile the example.

**What kiroku is.** kiroku (記録, "record/chronicle") is a high-performance, append-only
**PostgreSQL event store**. The core package is `kiroku-store`, built on `hasql` +
`effectful-core`. It is **NOT** a decider/aggregate/CQRS framework: there is **no**
`decide` / `evolve` / `fold` / `apply` / `project` typeclass anywhere in the library. Those
are user-land patterns you write on top of `appendToStream` / `readStream*`. State this
framing prominently; it shapes every page.

**Sub-packages (the family inside the kiroku repo):**

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `kiroku-store` | Core. Append/read/link/lifecycle/transaction/subscription/consumer-group/causation/notification/observability over immutable events. `hasql` + `effectful-core`. |
| `kiroku-store-migrations` | Embedded forward-only `codd` migrations (Template Haskell `embedDir`) + the `kiroku-store-migrate` executable. Owns the schema. |
| `kiroku-otel` | W3C trace-context inject/extract on event metadata, and a `KirokuEvent → IO ()` handler turning subscription state transitions into OpenTelemetry spans. |
| `kiroku-test-support` | `ephemeral-pg` test harness (shared server + per-test template-cloned databases, auto-migrated). |
| `shibuya-kiroku-adapter` | Bridges a kiroku subscription / consumer group into the **shibuya** pull queue-processing runtime, with ack-coupled checkpointing. |
| `kiroku-jitsurei` | Runnable worked example (executable `kiroku-consumer-group-example`): appends 120 events across 40 streams in category `example`, runs a 4-member consumer group, asserts complete + disjoint partitioning. The main idiomatic-usage seed. |

**Exposed modules of `kiroku-store` (import these paths):**

```text
Kiroku.Store                  -- umbrella; re-exports Types/Connection/Effect/Effect.Resource/Error/
                              --   Append/Causation/Lifecycle/Link/Read/Settings/Subscription/Transaction
Kiroku.Store.Types            -- core domain types
Kiroku.Store.Effect           -- the `Store` dynamic effect (GADT) + interpreters
Kiroku.Store.Effect.Resource  -- resourcet-style store handle for the effect
Kiroku.Store.Append           -- appendToStream / appendMultiStream
Kiroku.Store.Read             -- reads (stream / $all / category) + stream-id lookups
Kiroku.Store.Link             -- linkToStream
Kiroku.Store.Lifecycle        -- soft/hard/undelete stream
Kiroku.Store.Transaction      -- explicit BEGIN/COMMIT + serialization retry (escape hatch)
Kiroku.Store.Causation        -- correlation/causation graph reads
Kiroku.Store.Connection       -- ConnectionSettings, KirokuStore handle, withStore
Kiroku.Store.Settings         -- StoreSettings (enrich/decode hooks)
Kiroku.Store.Error            -- StoreError ADT
Kiroku.Store.Notification     -- LISTEN/NOTIFY notifier
Kiroku.Store.Observability    -- KirokuEvent operational-event taxonomy
Kiroku.Store.Subscription     -- subscribe / withSubscription (+ re-exports Subscription.Types)
```

**Core domain types (`Kiroku.Store.Types`, verbatim):**

```haskell
newtype StreamName     = StreamName Text       -- e.g. "orders-1"; prefix before first '-' = category
newtype StreamId       = StreamId Int64        -- DB surrogate id (rarely used by app code)
newtype EventId        = EventId UUID          -- UUIDv7 by default (NOT a typeid)
newtype EventType      = EventType Text        -- free-form discriminator, e.g. "OrderCreated"
newtype StreamVersion  = StreamVersion Int64   -- per-stream version; starts at 0, +1 per event
newtype GlobalPosition = GlobalPosition Int64  -- gap-free global $all counter; subscription cursor
newtype CategoryName   = CategoryName Text     -- prefix of a StreamName before first '-'
```

```haskell
data ExpectedVersion
  = NoStream                    -- must NOT exist; creates it. Else StreamAlreadyExists. (aggregate creation)
  | StreamExists                -- must exist (not soft-deleted), version irrelevant. Else StreamNotFound
  | ExactVersion !StreamVersion -- current version must match exactly. Else WrongExpectedVersion
  | AnyVersion                  -- upsert / create-or-append (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE)
```

```haskell
-- append INPUT
data EventData = EventData
  { eventId       :: !(Maybe EventId)  -- Nothing => store generates UUIDv7; Just => idempotent retries
  , eventType     :: !EventType
  , payload       :: !Aeson.Value      -- JSONB (DB column `data`)
  , metadata      :: !(Maybe Aeson.Value)
  , causationId   :: !(Maybe UUID)
  , correlationId :: !(Maybe UUID)
  }

-- read OUTPUT
data RecordedEvent = RecordedEvent
  { eventId          :: EventId
  , eventType        :: EventType
  , streamVersion    :: StreamVersion   -- position in the stream being read
  , globalPosition   :: GlobalPosition  -- $all position at append time; the subscription cursor
  , originalStreamId :: StreamId        -- source stream (only id present on fan-in reads)
  , originalVersion  :: StreamVersion
  , payload          :: Aeson.Value
  , metadata         :: Maybe Aeson.Value
  , causationId      :: Maybe UUID
  , correlationId    :: Maybe UUID
  , createdAt        :: UTCTime
  }

data AppendResult = AppendResult
  { streamId :: StreamId, streamVersion :: StreamVersion, globalPosition :: GlobalPosition }
  -- describes the LAST event in the batch

data LinkResult = LinkResult { streamId :: StreamId, streamVersion :: StreamVersion }
  -- no globalPosition: linking does not advance $all

data StreamInfo = StreamInfo
  { id :: StreamId, name :: StreamName, version :: StreamVersion
  , createdAt :: UTCTime, deletedAt :: Maybe UTCTime }

data EventFilter
  = FilterCorrelation !UUID
  | FilterCausationDescendants !EventId
  | FilterCausationAncestors !EventId
```

Records use `DuplicateRecordFields` + `OverloadedLabels` + `generic-lens`, so app code reads
fields with labels, e.g. `evt ^. #globalPosition`, `evt ^. #eventType`. The common stanza
also enables `OverloadedStrings` and `DeriveAnyClass`.

**Append API (`Kiroku.Store.Append`, verbatim):**

```haskell
appendToStream    :: (HasCallStack, Store :> es) => StreamName -> ExpectedVersion -> [EventData] -> Eff es AppendResult
appendMultiStream :: (HasCallStack, Store :> es) => [(StreamName, ExpectedVersion, [EventData])] -> Eff es [AppendResult]
```

All-or-nothing per call; read-your-own-writes on the same handle. `appendMultiStream`
pre-locks streams in `stream_id` order (deadlock-free). Appending to `$all` is rejected
(`ReservedStreamName`). An empty `[]` event list is a caller mistake. Idempotent retry:
supply `eventId`; a committed retry surfaces `DuplicateEvent`.

**Read API (`Kiroku.Store.Read`, verbatim):**

```haskell
readStreamForward       :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> StreamVersion -> Int32 -> Eff es (Vector RecordedEvent)
readStreamForwardStream :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> StreamVersion -> Int32 -> Stream (Eff es) RecordedEvent  -- Streamly, constant-memory paging (suggested pageSize 256)
readStreamBackward      :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> StreamVersion -> Int32 -> Eff es (Vector RecordedEvent)
readAllForward          :: (Store :> es) => GlobalPosition -> Int32 -> Eff es (Vector RecordedEvent)
readAllBackward         :: (Store :> es) => GlobalPosition -> Int32 -> Eff es (Vector RecordedEvent)
readCategory            :: (Store :> es) => CategoryName -> GlobalPosition -> Int32 -> Eff es (Vector RecordedEvent)
getStream               :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> Eff es (Maybe StreamInfo)
lookupStreamId          :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> Eff es (Maybe StreamId)
lookupStreamNames       :: (Store :> es) => [StreamId] -> Eff es (Map StreamId StreamName)  -- batch inverse (fan-in reads)
lookupStreamName        :: (Store :> es) => StreamId  -> Eff es (Maybe StreamName)
```

Cursors are **exclusive**: `StreamVersion 0` / `GlobalPosition 0` reads from the start
(for backward reads, `0` means "after everything"). The `$all` seed row (position 0) is never
returned. The `Int32` argument is the batch/page size.

**Link / Lifecycle / Causation (verbatim):**

```haskell
-- Kiroku.Store.Link — share events into another stream (no payload copy; keeps original globalPosition)
linkToStream :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> [EventId] -> Eff es LinkResult

-- Kiroku.Store.Lifecycle — all return Maybe StreamId (Nothing = not found / no-op); reject "$all"
softDeleteStream :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> Eff es (Maybe StreamId)   -- keeps events in $all
hardDeleteStream :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> Eff es (Maybe StreamId)   -- GUC-gated (kiroku.enable_hard_deletes); irreversible; GDPR
undeleteStream   :: (Store :> es) => StreamName -> Eff es (Maybe StreamId)

-- Kiroku.Store.Causation — graph walks over causation_id / correlation_id
findCausationDescendants :: (Store :> es) => EventId -> Eff es (Vector RecordedEvent)
findCausationAncestors   :: (Store :> es) => EventId -> Eff es (Vector RecordedEvent)
findByCorrelation        :: (Store :> es) => UUID    -> Eff es (Vector RecordedEvent)
```

**The `Store` effect + interpreters (`Kiroku.Store.Effect`, verbatim):**

```haskell
data Store :: Effect where
  AppendToStream      :: StreamName -> ExpectedVersion -> [EventData] -> Store m AppendResult
  AppendMultiStream   :: [(StreamName, ExpectedVersion, [EventData])] -> Store m [AppendResult]
  ReadStreamForward   :: StreamName -> StreamVersion -> Int32 -> Store m (Vector RecordedEvent)
  ReadStreamBackward  :: StreamName -> StreamVersion -> Int32 -> Store m (Vector RecordedEvent)
  ReadAllForward      :: GlobalPosition -> Int32 -> Store m (Vector RecordedEvent)
  ReadAllBackward     :: GlobalPosition -> Int32 -> Store m (Vector RecordedEvent)
  ReadCategoryForward :: CategoryName -> GlobalPosition -> Int32 -> Store m (Vector RecordedEvent)
  GetStream           :: StreamName -> Store m (Maybe StreamInfo)
  LookupStreamId      :: StreamName -> Store m (Maybe StreamId)
  LookupStreamNames   :: [StreamId] -> Store m (Map StreamId StreamName)
  LinkToStream        :: StreamName -> [EventId] -> Store m LinkResult
  FindEvents          :: EventFilter -> Store m (Vector RecordedEvent)
  SoftDeleteStream    :: StreamName -> Store m (Maybe StreamId)
  HardDeleteStream    :: StreamName -> Store m (Maybe StreamId)
  UndeleteStream      :: StreamName -> Store m (Maybe StreamId)
  RunTransaction        :: Tx.Transaction a -> Store m a   -- escape hatch (BEGIN/COMMIT, with retry)
  RunTransactionNoRetry :: Tx.Transaction a -> Store m a   -- exactly-once body
type instance DispatchOf Store = Dynamic
```

```haskell
runStorePool     :: (IOE :> es, Error StoreError :> es) => KirokuStore -> Eff (Store : es) a -> Eff es a
runStoreIO       :: KirokuStore -> Eff (Store : Error StoreError : IOE : '[]) a -> IO (Either StoreError a)
runStoreResource :: ...  -- resourcet-scoped variant
```

The effect is deliberately dynamic and the sums (the GADT, `EventFilter`) are closed, so
downstream code can supply mock interpreters in tests (e.g. a pure in-memory interpreter).
The only **shipped** backend is `runStorePool` over `hasql-pool`. `runStoreIO` is the
convenience runner used in the example.

**The store handle + connection settings (`Kiroku.Store.Connection`, verbatim):**

```haskell
data ConnectionSettingsM m = ConnectionSettings
  { connString :: Text, poolSize :: Int            -- default 10
  , schema :: Text                                  -- default "kiroku"; sets search_path AND the NOTIFY channel
  , extraSearchPath :: [Text]                       -- app schemas (e.g. public) for inline projection tables
  , idleInTransactionTimeout :: Int                 -- seconds, default 30
  , statementTimeout :: Maybe Int
  , observationHandler :: Maybe (Observation -> m ())   -- hasql-pool connection lifecycle
  , eventHandler :: Maybe (KirokuEvent -> m ())          -- store operational events
  , storeSettings :: StoreSettings }                      -- enrich/decode hooks
type ConnectionSettings = ConnectionSettingsM IO
defaultConnectionSettings :: Text -> ConnectionSettings

withStore :: (MonadUnliftIO m) => ConnectionSettings -> (KirokuStore -> m a) -> m a
```

`withStore` acquires the pool (sets `search_path`, timeouts), starts the **Notifier**
(`LISTEN <schema>.events`) and the **EventPublisher** (broadcasts new events to subscribers),
and tears them down in reverse. `StoreSettings` (`Kiroku.Store.Settings`) carries two hooks:
`enrichEvent :: Maybe (EventData -> IO EventData)` (append path; the OTel trace-context
injection seam) and `decodeHook :: Maybe (RecordedEvent -> IO RecordedEvent)` (read path;
decrypt/redact). Both default `Nothing`.

**Subscriptions / consumer groups (`Kiroku.Store.Subscription` + `Subscription.Types`):**

```haskell
subscribe       :: KirokuStore -> SubscriptionConfig -> IO SubscriptionHandle
withSubscription :: KirokuStore -> SubscriptionConfig -> (SubscriptionHandle -> IO a) -> IO a

-- smart constructor: defaultSubscriptionConfig name target handler
--   name    :: SubscriptionName
--   target  :: SubscriptionTarget   (AllStreams | Category CategoryName)
--   handler :: RecordedEvent -> IO SubscriptionResult   (Continue | Stop)
-- optional fields on SubscriptionConfig:
--   consumerGroup   :: Maybe ConsumerGroup            (ConsumerGroup { member, size })
--   overflowPolicy  :: OverflowPolicy                 (DropSubscription | DropOldest)
--   eventTypeFilter :: EventTypeFilter                (AllEventTypes | OnlyEventTypes [EventType])
--   retryPolicy     :: RetryPolicy                    (default 5 attempts, then dead-letter)
-- SubscriptionHandle = { cancel, wait, currentState }
```

Delivery is **at-least-once**; the checkpoint advances **per batch**, so handlers must be
idempotent. Consumer groups are **static hash-partitioned** by stream (ADR 0002): each member
owns a disjoint slice of streams; same-stream events stay ordered, distinct streams run in
parallel. Checkpoints live in the `subscriptions` table (`last_seen` cursor, keyed by
`(subscription_name, consumer_group_member)`).

**Idiomatic snippets (verbatim from `kiroku-jitsurei/app/Main.hs` — your snippet seed):**

```haskell
-- build events + append with runStoreIO
let evs = [ EventData { eventId = Nothing, eventType = EventType "ExampleEvent"
                      , payload = Aeson.object [], metadata = Nothing
                      , causationId = Nothing, correlationId = Nothing }
          | _ <- [1 .. 3 :: Int] ]
r <- runStoreIO store (appendToStream (StreamName sn) AnyVersion evs)   -- r :: Either StoreError AppendResult

-- open the store (AFTER migrations have been applied)
Pg.withCached \db ->
  withStore (defaultConnectionSettings (Pg.connectionString db)) \store -> do ...

-- subscribe as a consumer-group projection
let cfg = (defaultSubscriptionConfig (SubscriptionName "example-group")
                                     (Category (CategoryName "example"))
                                     handler)
            { consumerGroup = Just (ConsumerGroup { member = m, size = groupSize }) }
    handler evt = do modifyIORef' ref (evt ^. #globalPosition :); pure Continue
h <- subscribe store cfg            -- later: cancel h
```

**Schema (read-only background, distilled from the bootstrap migration):** objects live in a
dedicated `kiroku` schema (`public` stays free). Tables: `streams` (`stream_id BIGSERIAL`,
`stream_name TEXT UNIQUE`, generated `category` column = `split_part(stream_name,'-',1)`,
`stream_version`, `created_at`, `deleted_at`; **the `$all` stream is seeded as
`stream_id = 0`**); `events` (flat: `event_id UUID PK DEFAULT uuidv7()`, `event_type`,
`causation_id`, `correlation_id`, `data JSONB`, `metadata JSONB`, `created_at`);
`stream_events` (junction `(event_id, stream_id)` PK with `stream_version`,
`original_stream_id`, `original_stream_version` — **each event gets ≥2 rows: its source
stream + the `$all` stream (stream_id 0) + any links**, which is how `$all`/categories/links
work without copying payloads and how a contiguous global order is materialized — the
`stream_version` of the `$all` row IS the `GlobalPosition`); `subscriptions` (checkpoints);
`kiroku.dead_letters` (second migration). Triggers: `notify_events()` →
`pg_notify('<schema>.events', …)` (one NOTIFY per append), `prevent_mutation()`
(immutability), `protect_deletion()`/`protect_truncation()` (gated by GUC
`kiroku.enable_hard_deletes`). The store does **not** run DDL on open — migrate first.

**OpenTelemetry (`kiroku-otel`):**

```haskell
-- Kiroku.Otel.TraceContext
injectTraceContext  :: SpanContext -> EventData -> EventData    -- writes traceparent/tracestate into metadata
extractTraceContext :: RecordedEvent -> Maybe SpanContext       -- recovers producer span context; never throws
-- Kiroku.Otel.Subscription
subscriptionTraceHandler :: Tracer -> IO (KirokuEvent -> IO ())  -- install as ConnectionSettings.eventHandler
```

Enable tracing by setting `storeSettings.enrichEvent = Just (pure . injectTraceContext spanCtx)`
and `eventHandler = Just <$> subscriptionTraceHandler tracer` with your own
`TracerProvider`/exporter and a **batch** span processor.

**shibuya adapter (`shibuya-kiroku-adapter`, `Shibuya.Adapter.Kiroku`):**

```haskell
kirokuAdapter :: (IOE :> es) => KirokuStore -> KirokuAdapterConfig -> Eff es (Adapter es RecordedEvent)
defaultKirokuAdapterConfig    :: KirokuAdapterConfig
kirokuConsumerGroupProcessors :: ...  -- turns one KirokuConsumerGroupConfig into N named QueueProcessors
defaultConsumerGroupConfig    :: KirokuConsumerGroupConfig
```

It starts a kiroku subscription, bridges it through a bounded `TBQueue` via the **ack-coupled**
stream, and lifts it into shibuya's effectful stream; the handler's `AckDecision`
(`AckOk` / `AckRetry delay` / `AckDeadLetter reason` / `AckHalt`) drives kiroku checkpointing
per event. For consumer groups, each member is pinned to shibuya's
`(PartitionedInOrder, Serial)` policy.

**Existing kiroku docs to PORT from (map each page to its source):**

```text

### Diátaxis + Plan D templates (how to shape each page)

Diátaxis classifies docs into four modes; Plan D supplies a copy-me MDX template per mode
plus a Cookbook template. Match each page to its mode and copy that template's frontmatter +
section skeleton:

- **Tutorial** (learning-oriented): a guided, do-this-then-that lesson with a guaranteed
  outcome. Use the fumadocs `<Steps>` component for the numbered walkthrough.
- **How-To Guide** (task-oriented): solves one real problem for someone who already knows the
  basics. Plan D's label is exactly **"How-To Guides"**.
- **Reference** (information-oriented): dry, exhaustive, accurate. Use `<TypeTable>` for type
  fields; one subsection per operation/type.
- **Explanation** (understanding-oriented): discursive background and rationale; no steps.
- **Cookbook**: a short, self-contained recipe (problem → solution → snippet).

Conventions carried from Plan D / the master brief: lowercase-kanji product names ("kiroku",
not "Kiroku" in nav labels — but normal sentence-initial capitalization in prose is fine);
"jitsurei" is the word for a worked example; the nav label for the task section is
"How-To Guides". Prefer fumadocs-ui built-ins (`Callout`, `Steps`, `Tabs`, `Cards`,
`TypeTable`) over custom components.

### Fence/formatting rules (hard requirement)

Every fenced code block MUST carry a language tag. Use: ` ```haskell ` for Haskell,
` ```mdx ` for MDX page bodies, ` ```json ` for `meta.json`, ` ```mermaid ` for diagrams,
` ```bash ` for shell, ` ```text ` for plain transcripts. Never write a bare ```` ``` ````.
Include at least one ` ```mermaid ` diagram (the append → store → subscribe flow) and
Haskell snippets that contain ligature-bearing operators (`->`, `=>`, `<-`, `::`, `>>=`,
`<$>`) so Plan B's ligature rendering is demonstrably exercised.


## Plan of Work

The work is one milestone per logical page group, each independently verifiable by building
the site and viewing the page. Author pages in IA order. The final milestone wires the
sidebar (`meta.json`) and runs the full acceptance checks.

**Page set and file map (everything under `content/docs/kiroku/`).** Each entry gives the
file path, Diátaxis type (→ Plan D template), the source doc it ports from, and the key
snippet/diagram it must contain. Detailed per-page outlines follow in Concrete Steps.

| File | Diátaxis type → template | Ports from | Key snippet/diagram |

**Milestones:**

- **M0 — Preconditions.** Confirm Plan A and Plan D have landed and that
  `content/docs/kiroku/` exists. At the end: `pnpm dev` runs and you can browse the empty
  site. Acceptance: `pnpm build` succeeds before you add any kiroku page.
- **M1 — Landing + overview** (`index.mdx`). At the end: `/docs/kiroku` renders with a short
  intro, the "store, not a framework" framing, a `<Cards>` index, and the
  append→store→subscribe ` ```mermaid ` diagram. Acceptance: page builds and renders.
- **M2 — Getting-started tutorial** (`getting-started.mdx`). At the end: a reader can follow
  migrate → open store → append → read → subscribe with real-API snippets. Acceptance: page
  builds; every `appendToStream`/`readStreamForward`/`subscribe` call matches §Context
  signatures.
- **M3 — Explanation set** (7 pages under `explanation/`). Acceptance: all build and render;
  the `$all`/global-order page contains a ` ```mermaid ` junction diagram.
- **M4 — Reference seed** (`reference/store-effect.mdx`, `reference/core-types.mdx`).
  Acceptance: every signature is copy-exact from §Context; `<TypeTable>` lists every field.
- **M5 — How-to guides** (4 pages under `how-to-guides/`). Acceptance: each guide solves its
  one task end-to-end with real-API snippets.
- **M6 — Cookbook recipe** (`cookbook/idempotent-append.mdx`). Acceptance: recipe builds.
- **M7 — Known-gap tutorial** (`tutorials/decider-and-evolve.mdx`). Acceptance: presents
  `decide`/`evolve` as user-land code with a Callout stating kiroku ships no such typeclass.
- **M8 — Sidebar + full acceptance** (`meta.json` + verification). Acceptance: see Validation.


## Concrete Steps

Run all commands from the repo root `/Users/shinzui/Keikaku/bokuno/keiro-runtime-docs`
unless stated otherwise. The docs toolchain is **pnpm** on **Node 22**.

### M0 — Preconditions

```bash
# enter the Nix dev shell (pnpm + Node 22) first
nix develop

# confirm the scaffold (Plan A — TanStack Start static SPA) and the IA (Plan D) are present
test -f source.config.ts && test -f src/lib/source.ts && test -f vite.config.ts && echo "Plan A present"
test -d content/docs/kiroku && echo "Plan D kiroku dir present" || mkdir -p content/docs/kiroku

# install + verify the empty site builds before you start
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Expected (abridged):

```text
Plan A present
Plan D kiroku dir present
✓ built in <N>s
```

If `content/docs/kiroku/` does not exist, Plan D has not landed; stop and finish Plan D first
(this is a HARD DEP). If `pnpm build` fails on the empty site, fix Plan A first.

Create the subdirectories you will populate:

```bash
mkdir -p content/docs/kiroku/explanation \
         content/docs/kiroku/reference \
         content/docs/kiroku/how-to-guides \
         content/docs/kiroku/cookbook \
         content/docs/kiroku/tutorials
```

Cross-check tooling for snippet accuracy (optional but recommended): you can compile the
worked example to confirm the API names you are quoting still exist.

```bash
# from the kiroku repo (read-only; do not edit it)
cd /Users/shinzui/Keikaku/bokuno/kiroku-project/kiroku && cabal build kiroku-jitsurei
```

### M1 — `content/docs/kiroku/index.mdx` (Landing / Overview)

Outline: (1) one-paragraph "what kiroku is" (append-only PostgreSQL event store; persistence
foundation of the keiro runtime); (2) a `<Callout type="info">` stating it is a STORE, not a
decider/aggregate framework — `decide`/`evolve` are user-land patterns; (3) the
append→store→subscribe flow diagram; (4) a `<Cards>` block linking to Getting Started,
Explanation, Reference, How-To Guides, Cookbook. Ports from `docs/user/README.md` + root
`README.md`. The page body is shown below inside a four-backtick fence so the inner
` ```mermaid ` block is preserved verbatim:

````mdx
---
title: kiroku
description: An append-only PostgreSQL event store — the persistence foundation of the keiro runtime.
---

import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';
import { Cards, Card } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/card';

**kiroku** (記録, "record / chronicle") is a high-performance, append-only **PostgreSQL
event store**, built on `hasql` and `effectful-core`. It is the persistence foundation of the
keiro runtime family: other components write their history through it.

<Callout type="info">
kiroku is an event **store**, not a decider or aggregate framework. It gives you durable,
ordered, immutable events plus optimistic concurrency and subscriptions. Patterns such as
`decide` / `evolve` / projections are application code you write on top — see the
[decider/evolve tutorial](/docs/kiroku/tutorials/decider-and-evolve).
</Callout>

## How it fits together

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  App["Your application"] -- "appendToStream name ExpectedVersion [EventData]" --> Store[("kiroku-store\nPostgreSQL")]
  Store -- "writes source-stream row + $all row (stream_id 0)" --> AllLog["$all log\n(gap-free GlobalPosition)"]
  Store -- "pg_notify '<schema>.events'" --> Notifier["Notifier (LISTEN/NOTIFY)"]
  Notifier --> Sub["subscribe / consumer group"]
  Sub -- "RecordedEvent -> IO SubscriptionResult" --> Proj["Your projection / read model"]
```

<Cards>
  <Card title="Getting started" href="/docs/kiroku/getting-started" />
  <Card title="Explanation" href="/docs/kiroku/explanation/event-sourcing" />
  <Card title="Reference" href="/docs/kiroku/reference/store-effect" />
  <Card title="How-To Guides" href="/docs/kiroku/how-to-guides/run-against-postgres" />
</Cards>
````

(Confirm the exact `fumadocs-ui` 16.9.3 import paths for `Callout`/`Cards` against Plan A's
MDX registry `src/components/mdx.tsx`; if those components are globally registered there
via `getMDXComponents`, drop the `import` lines.)

### M2 — `content/docs/kiroku/getting-started.mdx` (Tutorial)

Use the Plan D **Tutorial** template; wrap the walkthrough in `<Steps>`. Outline:
**Prerequisites** (PostgreSQL 17+, GHC 9.12, the `kiroku-store` + `kiroku-store-migrations`
packages) → **Step 1 Apply the schema** (`kiroku-store-migrate`, `CODD_*` env) → **Step 2
Open a store** (`withStore (defaultConnectionSettings connStr)`) → **Step 3 Append your first
events** (`appendToStream … NoStream`, explain `NoStream` creates the stream) → **Step 4 Read
the stream back** (`readStreamForward name (StreamVersion 0) 100`, explain exclusive cursor)
→ **Step 5 Subscribe** (`defaultSubscriptionConfig` + `subscribe`, handler returns
`Continue`) → **What you built / next steps** (link to decider/evolve tutorial + projection
how-to). Ports from `docs/user/getting-started.md`, `kiroku-store-migrations/README.md`, and
`kiroku-jitsurei/app/Main.hs`.

    Right (appended, evs) -> do
      putStrLn ("appended up to version " <> show (appended ^. #streamVersion))
      mapM_ (\e -> putStrLn (show (e ^. #eventType) <> " @ " <> show (e ^. #globalPosition))) evs
```

```haskell
-- Step 5: subscribe to the live + catch-up stream and fold events
import Data.IORef

projection :: KirokuStore -> IO ()
projection store = do
  ref <- newIORef (0 :: Int)
  let cfg     = defaultSubscriptionConfig (SubscriptionName "order-count") AllStreams handler
      handler evt = do
        modifyIORef' ref (+ 1)
        pure Continue                                  -- ack this event; keep going
  withSubscription store cfg $ \h -> do
    -- ... let it run; h ^. #currentState shows catch-up vs live ...
    h ^. #wait
```

```bash
# Step 1: apply the schema first (the store never runs DDL on open)
export CODD_CONNECTION='dbname=kiroku'
export CODD_SCHEMAS=kiroku
cabal run kiroku-store-migrate
```

Add a `<Callout type="warn">` noting cursors are exclusive (`StreamVersion 0` reads from the
start) and that subscription delivery is at-least-once, so handlers must be idempotent.

### M3 — Explanation set (`content/docs/kiroku/explanation/*.mdx`)

Use the Plan D **Explanation** template (prose, no steps) for each. Per-page outline + key
content:

1. `event-sourcing.mdx` — "Event store, not a framework." What kiroku gives you (durable
   ordered immutable events, optimistic concurrency, subscriptions) vs what you write
   (commands, `decide`, `evolve`, projections). Reuse the M1 Callout. Ports `docs/DESIGN.md`.
2. `append-only-log.mdx` — immutability is enforced in the database (`prevent_mutation`
   trigger; updates/deletes blocked); soft delete keeps events in `$all`, hard delete is
   GUC-gated and irreversible (GDPR). Ports `docs/user/schema.md` + `docs/DESIGN.md`.
3. `streams-and-categories.mdx` — `StreamName "orders-1"`; the **category** is the prefix
   before the first `-` (`orders`), materialized as a generated column
   (`split_part(stream_name,'-',1)`); read a category with `readCategory`. Mention ADR 0001
   (resolve stream names by `lookupStreamNames`, not from a `RecordedEvent` field). Ports
   `docs/user/schema.md`, ADR 0001.
4. `all-stream-and-global-order.mdx` — the `stream_events` junction writes each event to its
   source stream AND the `$all` stream (`stream_id = 0`) in the same transaction; the
   `stream_version` of the `$all` row IS the `GlobalPosition`, giving **gap-free** global
   order under all four `ExpectedVersion` paths. Include this diagram:

   ```mermaid
   flowchart TD
     E["events row\n(event_id, data, ...)"] --> S1["stream_events\nstream_id = orders-1\nstream_version = 0"]
     E --> S0["stream_events\nstream_id = 0 ($all)\nstream_version = GlobalPosition"]
     S0 --> Cur["Subscription cursor\nreads $all by GlobalPosition"]
   ```

   Ports `docs/DESIGN.md`, `docs/architecture/subscriptions.md`.
5. `optimistic-concurrency.mdx` — the four `ExpectedVersion` constructors and the `StoreError`
   each can produce: `NoStream` → `StreamAlreadyExists`; `StreamExists` → `StreamNotFound`;
   `ExactVersion v` → `WrongExpectedVersion`; `AnyVersion` → upsert (no conflict). Add
   `DuplicateEvent`/`ReservedStreamName`. Ports `docs/user/appending-events.md`.
6. `subscriptions-and-consumer-groups.mdx` — catch-up vs live (FSM), LISTEN/NOTIFY wake-ups,
   at-least-once + per-batch checkpoint ⇒ idempotent handlers, static hash-partitioned
   consumer groups (ADR 0002), retry → dead-letters. Ports `docs/user/subscriptions.md`,
   `docs/user/consumer-groups.md`, ADR 0002, `docs/architecture/subscriptions.md`.
7. `causation-and-correlation.mdx` — `causationId` = immediate cause (parent event);
   `correlationId` = the whole saga/flow; query with `findCausationAncestors` /
   `findCausationDescendants` / `findByCorrelation` (or the `EventFilter` constructors). Ports
   `docs/user/causation-correlation.md`.

### M4 — Reference seed (`content/docs/kiroku/reference/*.mdx`)

Use the Plan D **Reference** template. Dry, exhaustive, one subsection per item.

`store-effect.mdx`: paste the `Store` GADT, then a subsection per smart-constructor op
(`appendToStream`, `appendMultiStream`, the six read ops, `getStream`, the three lookup ops,
`linkToStream`, the three lifecycle ops, the three causation ops, `RunTransaction` /
`RunTransactionNoRetry`) each with its exact signature from §Context and a one-line semantics
note. Then the interpreters subsection:

```haskell
runStorePool     :: (IOE :> es, Error StoreError :> es) => KirokuStore -> Eff (Store : es) a -> Eff es a
runStoreIO       :: KirokuStore -> Eff (Store : Error StoreError : IOE : '[]) a -> IO (Either StoreError a)
runStoreResource :: KirokuStore -> Eff (Store : es) a -> Eff es a  -- resourcet-scoped
```

Add a Callout: the effect is dynamic and closed by design so you can supply a pure in-memory
interpreter in tests; the only shipped backend is `runStorePool`.

`core-types.mdx`: a `<TypeTable>` for `EventData` and `RecordedEvent` (field → type → note,
copied from §Context), the five `newtype`s, and constructor catalogs for `ExpectedVersion`
and `StoreError` (`StreamAlreadyExists`, `StreamNotFound`, `WrongExpectedVersion`,
`DuplicateEvent`, `ReservedStreamName`, plus any others present in `Kiroku.Store.Error` — open
that module to enumerate exactly). Example `<TypeTable>`:

```mdx
import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

<TypeTable
  type={{
    eventId:       { type: 'Maybe EventId', description: 'Nothing => store generates UUIDv7; Just => idempotent retry key' },
    eventType:     { type: 'EventType',     description: 'Free-form discriminator, e.g. "OrderPlaced"' },
    payload:       { type: 'Aeson.Value',   description: 'JSONB body (DB column `data`)' },
    metadata:      { type: 'Maybe Aeson.Value', description: 'Optional JSONB metadata' },
    causationId:   { type: 'Maybe UUID',    description: 'Immediate-cause event id' },
    correlationId: { type: 'Maybe UUID',    description: 'Saga/flow id' },
  }}
/>
```

### M5 — How-to guides (`content/docs/kiroku/how-to-guides/*.mdx`)

Use the Plan D **How-To Guide** template (task-focused; assumes the basics). One task each:

1. `run-against-postgres.mdx` — install/upgrade the schema with `kiroku-store-migrate` and the
   `CODD_*` env (`CODD_CONNECTION`, `CODD_SCHEMAS=kiroku`), then configure `ConnectionSettings`
   (`connString`, `poolSize` default 10, `schema` default "kiroku", `extraSearchPath` for app
   tables, timeouts). Note the dedicated `kiroku` schema (ADR 0003) and that the store never
   runs DDL on open. Ports `kiroku-store-migrations/README.md`, `docs/user/schema-migrations.md`.

   ```haskell
   let settings = (defaultConnectionSettings "postgresql://localhost/app")
                    { poolSize        = 20
                    , schema          = "kiroku"
                    , extraSearchPath = ["public"]   -- so inline projection tables resolve
                    }
   withStore settings $ \store -> ...
   ```

2. `enable-opentelemetry.mdx` — inject trace context on append via the `enrichEvent` hook and
   turn subscription lifecycle into spans via `eventHandler`. Ports `docs/user/opentelemetry.md`,
   `docs/user/observability.md`.

   ```haskell
   import Kiroku.Otel.TraceContext (injectTraceContext)
   import Kiroku.Otel.Subscription (subscriptionTraceHandler)

   withOtel tracer spanCtx connStr action = do
     handler <- subscriptionTraceHandler tracer
     let settings = (defaultConnectionSettings connStr)
           { eventHandler  = Just handler
           , storeSettings = (storeSettings (defaultConnectionSettings connStr))
               { enrichEvent = Just (pure . injectTraceContext spanCtx) }
           }
     withStore settings action
   ```

   Callout: use a **batch** span processor so the synchronous worker callback never stalls.

3. `build-a-projection.mdx` — consume `$all` (or a category) with a subscription and fold each
   `RecordedEvent` into a read model, advancing nothing yourself (kiroku checkpoints per
   batch). Show the handler shape and the idempotency requirement; mention inline projections
   via `RunTransaction` (append + read-model row in one transaction). Ports
   `docs/guides/building-a-projection.md`, `docs/guides/consuming-the-event-log.md`,
   `kiroku-jitsurei`.

   ```haskell
   let cfg = defaultSubscriptionConfig (SubscriptionName "orders-readmodel")
                                       (Category (CategoryName "orders"))
                                       handler
       handler evt = do
         upsertReadModel (evt ^. #eventType) (evt ^. #payload)  -- idempotent!
         pure Continue
   withSubscription store cfg $ \h -> h ^. #wait
   ```

4. `integrate-with-shibuya.mdx` — present a kiroku subscription as a shibuya `Adapter` /
   consumer-group `QueueProcessor`s, and explain `AckDecision` driving kiroku checkpointing.
   Ports `docs/user/shibuya-adapter.md`.

   ```haskell
   import Shibuya.Adapter.Kiroku (kirokuAdapter, defaultKirokuAdapterConfig)

   buildAdapter store = kirokuAdapter store defaultKirokuAdapterConfig
   -- handler returns AckOk | AckRetry delay | AckDeadLetter reason | AckHalt,
   -- which drives kiroku checkpointing per event.
   ```

### M6 — Cookbook recipe (`content/docs/kiroku/cookbook/idempotent-append.mdx`)

Use the Plan D **Cookbook** template (problem → solution → snippet). Recipe: idempotent append
with a supplied `EventId`, so a retried command does not double-write. Ports
`docs/user/appending-events.md`.

```haskell
import Data.UUID.V7 (genUUID)   -- or reuse a deterministic id derived from the command

idempotentAppend :: KirokuStore -> StreamName -> EventId -> Aeson.Value -> IO (Either StoreError AppendResult)
idempotentAppend store name eid body =
  runStoreIO store $
    appendToStream name AnyVersion
      [ EventData
          { eventId       = Just eid              -- supplying the id makes the retry a no-op
          , eventType     = EventType "OrderPlaced"
          , payload       = body
          , metadata      = Nothing
          , causationId   = Nothing
          , correlationId = Nothing
          }
      ]
-- A committed retry of the same eventId surfaces `DuplicateEvent` — treat it as success.
```

### M7 — Known-gap tutorial (`content/docs/kiroku/tutorials/decider-and-evolve.mdx`)

Use the Plan D **Tutorial** template. This documents a pattern kiroku does **not** ship. Open
with a `<Callout type="warn">`: "kiroku ships no `decide`/`evolve`/`fold` typeclass — the code
below is application code you write on top of the store." Outline: define a domain
(`Order`) and its events → write `evolve :: State -> Event -> State` (fold) → write
`decide :: Command -> State -> Either Error [Event]` → the command loop: read the stream, fold
to current state with `evolve`, run `decide`, append the resulting events under
`ExactVersion currentVersion` (so a concurrent writer fails with `WrongExpectedVersion`,
which you retry). Ports the pattern from `docs/guides/process-managers-and-sagas.md` + the
framing in `docs/DESIGN.md`.

```haskell
-- USER-LAND pattern (NOT a kiroku API): decider + evolve over the append-only log.
data OrderState = NoOrder | Open { items :: Int } | Closed deriving (Show)
data OrderEvent = OrderPlaced | ItemAdded | OrderClosed deriving (Show)
data OrderCmd   = PlaceOrder | AddItem | CloseOrder

evolve :: OrderState -> OrderEvent -> OrderState
evolve NoOrder      OrderPlaced = Open { items = 0 }
evolve (Open n)     ItemAdded   = Open { items = n + 1 }
evolve (Open _)     OrderClosed = Closed
evolve st           _           = st        -- ignore impossible transitions

decide :: OrderCmd -> OrderState -> Either String [OrderEvent]
decide PlaceOrder NoOrder    = Right [OrderPlaced]
decide AddItem    (Open _)   = Right [ItemAdded]
decide CloseOrder (Open _)   = Right [OrderClosed]
decide _          _          = Left "invalid command for current state"

-- the command loop: load -> fold -> decide -> append under ExactVersion
handle :: KirokuStore -> StreamName -> OrderCmd -> IO (Either StoreError ())
handle store name cmd = runStoreIO store $ do
  recorded <- readStreamForward name (StreamVersion 0) 1000
  let current  = foldl' evolve NoOrder (map decodeEvent (Vector.toList recorded))
      expected = ExactVersion (StreamVersion (fromIntegral (Vector.length recorded) - 1))
  case decide cmd current of
    Left _       -> pure ()
    Right events -> () <$ appendToStream name expected (map encodeEvent events)
  -- On WrongExpectedVersion: someone else wrote concurrently — re-read and retry.
```

(`decodeEvent`/`encodeEvent` are your `RecordedEvent`↔domain converters — show stubs.)

### M8 — Sidebar (`content/docs/kiroku/meta.json`) + ordering

Write the kiroku sidebar config. fumadocs uses `pages` to order entries; nested directories
appear as collapsible groups (each subdirectory may carry its own `meta.json` to set the group
title/order — add those if Plan D's convention requires per-directory meta; otherwise a single
root meta with directory names works).

```json
{
  "title": "kiroku",
  "icon": "Database",
  "pages": [
    "index",
    "getting-started",
    "explanation",
    "reference",
    "how-to-guides",
    "tutorials",
    "cookbook"
  ]
}
```

Add per-subdirectory `meta.json` files to title/order the groups, for example
`content/docs/kiroku/explanation/meta.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "Explanation",
  "pages": [
    "event-sourcing",
    "append-only-log",
    "streams-and-categories",
    "all-stream-and-global-order",
    "optimistic-concurrency",
    "subscriptions-and-consumer-groups",
    "causation-and-correlation"
  ]
}
```

Mirror the same shape for `reference/meta.json` (`["store-effect","core-types"]`),
`how-to-guides/meta.json` (`["run-against-postgres","enable-opentelemetry","build-a-projection","integrate-with-shibuya"]`, title `"How-To Guides"`),
`tutorials/meta.json` (`["decider-and-evolve"]`), and
`cookbook/meta.json` (`["idempotent-append"]`).

Finally ensure the top-level `content/docs/meta.json` (owned/structured by Plan D) lists
`kiroku` in its `pages`. If it already does, change nothing else there.

```bash
# build with the full kiroku tree in place
pnpm build
pnpm dev   # then browse http://localhost:3000/docs/kiroku
```


## Validation and Acceptance

Exercise the system and observe specific behaviors:

1. **Section builds.** From the repo root, `pnpm build` (`vite build`) exits 0 with the kiroku
   pages present; it emits the static SPA under `.output/public`. Run `pnpm typecheck`
   (`fumadocs-mdx && tsc --noEmit`) too, so the generated `.source/` collection picks up the
   new pages. Expected tail (abridged):

   ```text
   ✓ built in <N>s
   .output/public/...
   ```

2. **Renders in the sidebar.** `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm build && pnpm start`), open
   `http://localhost:3000/docs/kiroku`. Because this is a static SPA, the page tree and MDX
   render client-side in the browser. The
   sidebar shows kiroku with children in the `meta.json` order: Getting started, Explanation
   (7 pages), Reference (2), How-To Guides (4), Tutorials (1), Cookbook (1). Every page opens
   without a 404 and shows its frontmatter `title`.

3. **Haskell shows ligatures** (requires Plan B). On the getting-started page, the
   `appendToStream` snippet renders `->`, `=>`, `<-`, `::`, `>>=`/`<$>` as ligature glyphs in
   PragmataPro. Verify visually (zoom the browser) or inspect that the code element uses the
   `--fd-font-mono` PragmataPro family with `font-feature-settings: "liga" 1, "calt" 1`. If
   Plan B is not yet merged, record this check as deferred in Progress.

4. **Mermaid is interactive** (requires Plan C). On the landing page and the
   `all-stream-and-global-order` page, the ` ```mermaid ` fences render as diagrams with
   zoom/pan controls (not as a code block). If Plan C is not yet merged, confirm the fence at
   least renders as a fenced block and record the interactivity check as deferred.

5. **Snippets match the real API.** Cross-check every Haskell snippet against the exposed
   modules:

   ```bash
   # confirm the API names the docs quote actually exist / still compile
   cd /Users/shinzui/Keikaku/bokuno/kiroku-project/kiroku && cabal build kiroku-jitsurei
   # grep the source for each name used in a snippet, e.g.:
   grep -rn "appendToStream ::" kiroku-store/src
   grep -rn "data ExpectedVersion" kiroku-store/src
   grep -rn "defaultSubscriptionConfig" kiroku-store/src
   ```

   Acceptance: every function/type/constructor named in a snippet appears in
   `kiroku-store/src` (or `kiroku-otel`/`shibuya-kiroku-adapter` for those pages) with the
   signature transcribed in this plan. The decider/evolve tutorial is the exception — its
   `decide`/`evolve` are explicitly labeled user-land and must NOT be presented as kiroku API.

6. **Framing is correct.** Search the kiroku content for any claim that kiroku provides
   `decide`/`evolve`/aggregate typeclasses outside the user-land tutorial; there must be none.

   ```bash
   grep -rn "decide\|evolve" content/docs/kiroku | grep -v tutorials/decider-and-evolve
   ```

   Expected: no matches that present these as kiroku APIs.


## Idempotence and Recovery

All steps are file authoring and are safe to repeat: re-running `pnpm build`/`pnpm dev` is
idempotent; editing or recreating an `.mdx`/`meta.json` file simply overwrites it. Creating
the subdirectories with `mkdir -p` is idempotent. No database or kiroku source is modified by
this plan (the kiroku tree is opened read-only for cross-checking only).

Recovery:
- If a page breaks the build, the error names the offending `.mdx` file and line; fix the MDX
  (most often an untagged fence, an unimported component, or a stray `<` in prose) and rebuild.
- If the sidebar order or a group is wrong, edit the relevant `meta.json` `pages` array; no
  rebuild of other pages is needed.
- To start a page over, delete the `.mdx` and re-author from its row in the file-map table.
- If you discover a snippet diverges from the real API, fix the snippet to match
  `kiroku-store/src` (the source is authoritative over this plan's transcription) and note the
  divergence in Surprises & Discoveries.


## Interfaces and Dependencies

**Libraries / systems referenced by the content (Haskell, the documented subject):**
- `kiroku-store` (modules `Kiroku.Store`, `…Types`, `…Effect`, `…Append`, `…Read`, `…Link`,
  `…Lifecycle`, `…Causation`, `…Connection`, `…Settings`, `…Error`, `…Subscription`) — the
  core event store; supplies every type and operation transcribed in Context.
- `kiroku-store-migrations` (`Kiroku.Store.Migrations`, exe `kiroku-store-migrate`) — schema
  install/upgrade; referenced by the run-against-postgres how-to and getting-started.
- `kiroku-otel` (`Kiroku.Otel.TraceContext`, `Kiroku.Otel.Subscription`) — referenced by the
  OpenTelemetry how-to.
- `shibuya-kiroku-adapter` (`Shibuya.Adapter.Kiroku`) — referenced by the shibuya how-to.

**Tooling / app (TypeScript, the docs site — TanStack Start static SPA):**
- fumadocs (`fumadocs-core` 16.9.3, `fumadocs-ui` 16.9.3, `fumadocs-mdx` 15.0.10) — MDX
  content + sidebar from `meta.json`; built-in components `Callout`, `Steps`, `Tabs`,
  `Cards`, `TypeTable`, registered in `src/components/mdx.tsx`. Loader/config in
  `src/lib/source.ts` and `source.config.ts`.
- TanStack Start + Vite — `pnpm dev` = `vite dev`; `pnpm build` = `vite build` (static SPA in
  `.output/public`); `pnpm start` serves it; `pnpm typecheck` = `fumadocs-mdx && tsc --noEmit`.
- pnpm + Node 22 inside the Nix dev shell (`nix develop`) — `pnpm install`, `pnpm build`,
  `pnpm dev`.

**Files this plan creates/owns (all under `content/docs/kiroku/`):**
`index.mdx`, `getting-started.mdx`, `meta.json`; `explanation/{event-sourcing,append-only-log,
streams-and-categories,all-stream-and-global-order,optimistic-concurrency,
subscriptions-and-consumer-groups,causation-and-correlation}.mdx` + `explanation/meta.json`;
`reference/{store-effect,core-types}.mdx` + `reference/meta.json`;
`how-to-guides/{run-against-postgres,enable-opentelemetry,build-a-projection,
integrate-with-shibuya}.mdx` + `how-to-guides/meta.json`;
`cookbook/idempotent-append.mdx` + `cookbook/meta.json`;
`tutorials/decider-and-evolve.mdx` + `tutorials/meta.json`.

**Files this plan touches but does not own:** `content/docs/meta.json` (Plan D) — only ensure
`kiroku` is listed in `pages`.

**Postconditions / interfaces that must exist at the end:**
- Every file above exists and the site builds (`pnpm build` exits 0).
- The kiroku subtree renders in the sidebar in the order set by the `meta.json` files.
- Each Haskell snippet uses only names present in the kiroku source (verified per Validation
  step 5), except the explicitly user-land `decide`/`evolve` tutorial.
- At least one interactive `mermaid` diagram (the append→store→subscribe flow) and
  ligature-bearing Haskell snippets are present (proving Plans C and B once merged).

## Revision note — Next.js → TanStack Start pivot (2026-05-30)

This plan was originally written assuming the docs app was a fumadocs **Next.js** app. The
project has since **pivoted to TanStack Start built as a static SPA** (React 19 + Vite +
fumadocs-ui 16.9.3 / fumadocs-mdx 15.0.10), and Plan A (the scaffold,
`docs/plans/1-scaffold-the-fumadocs-documentation-app.md`) has already been re-implemented and
committed on that stack. This revision updates **only the framework-specific mechanics**;
the authoring substance — the MDX content, Haskell snippets, YAML frontmatter, Diátaxis
mapping, page set, and all kiroku-repo source-of-truth paths (e.g.
`kiroku-jitsurei/app/Main.hs`, `kiroku-store/src`) — is unchanged, since it is
framework-agnostic.

What changed:

- Docs-app file references remapped to the TanStack layout: `mdx-components.tsx` →
  `src/components/mdx.tsx`; `lib/source.ts` → `src/lib/source.ts`; `app/global.css` →
  `src/styles/app.css`; `next.config.mjs` → `vite.config.ts`. The import alias `@/...`
  resolves to `./src/...`. App Router (`app/...`) no longer exists; routing is file-based
  under `src/routes/`, but this plan authors content under `content/docs/`, which is
  unchanged.
- Commands remapped: `next dev`/`pnpm dev` → `vite dev` (`pnpm dev`); `next build`/`pnpm build`
  → `vite build` (`pnpm build`), which emits a **static SPA in `.output/public`** served by
  `pnpm start`; `pnpm typecheck` = `fumadocs-mdx && tsc --noEmit`. All commands run from the
  repo root in the Nix dev shell (`nix develop`, pnpm + Node 22).
- Verification updated: browse via `pnpm dev` or `pnpm build && pnpm start` at
  `http://localhost:3000/docs/kiroku`. MDX renders **client-side** in the SPA, so the rendered
  tree/content appears in the browser. Build-output expectations changed from the Next.js
  "Compiled successfully / Generating static pages" banner to Vite's `built in <N>s` plus the
  `.output/public` artifact.
- Soft deps unchanged in intent: Plan B (`docs/plans/2-pragmatapro-font-and-shiki-code-ligatures.md`)
  supplies the Shiki Haskell highlighter + ligatures via `source.config.ts`; Plan C
  (`docs/plans/3-beautiful-mermaid-diagrams-with-zoom-pan.md`) supplies interactive Mermaid via
  the registry in `src/components/mdx.tsx`. `haskell` and `mermaid` fences are authored now and
  light up once B and C land.
